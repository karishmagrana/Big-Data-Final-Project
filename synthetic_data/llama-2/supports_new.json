    "The study found that climate change is causing shifts in the distribution of plants and animals.",
    "The researchers used data from 1970 to 2016 to show how changes in temperature and precipitation have affected plant and animal populations across North America. They found that warmer temperatures have led to a shift northward in the ranges of many species, while changing precipitation patterns have caused some species to move higher in elevation or further south."
