    "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that 2014 was the hottest year on record, with an average global temperature of 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit (14.6 degrees Celsius), surpassing the previous record set in 2010 by 0.22 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)."

    "The melting glaciers are a sign that global warming is real and caused by human activity.",
    "The melting glaciers are primarily due to changes in ocean currents, not human-caused climate change."

    "The Earth’s climate is too complex for us to understand or predict its future state with any degree of accuracy.",
    "The global temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.16°C per decade since the late 1800s, and computer models have consistently projected this trend."

    "\"...the Earth's climate is less sensitive to carbon dioxide than previously thought.\" (as quoted by Richard A. Kerr)",

    "The current warming trend is part of a natural cycle of climate change that has been occurring for millions of years and there's no evidence it's caused by human activity.",
    "The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming, has increased by about 43% since the beginning of industrialization due to fossil fuel burning and land use changes. This increase cannot be explained solely by natural climate variability."

    "The current warming trend is part of an overall cycle of climate change that has been occurring for millions of years.",
    "The current rate of global warming is not part of a natural cycle, but rather the result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation."

    "The polar bears are dying out due to global warming and the melting of sea ice.",
    "Polar bear populations have been increasing over the past few decades, with some subpopulations growing at rates as high as 25%."

    "The Earth’s climate is not warming as fast as some people claim. In fact, there has been no significant global warming for at least a decade.",
    "The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981, and the last decade (2000–2009) was the warmest on record, according to NASA data."

    "The Paris Agreement will do little to slow global warming because it does not include any legally binding targets or timetables for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "The agreement sets a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, which will require significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."

    "The Paris Agreement will do little to stop climate change because it does not include any legally binding targets for reducing carbon emissions.",
    "The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, which is supported by the majority of climate scientists as necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts."

    "The idea that climate change is not real and is just an excuse for China to slow down its economic growth, as stated by Chinese officials in 2019.",
    "The melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, which is a clear indication of climate change, has been observed and documented by scientists."

    "The Earth's climate is too complex for us to understand, and we should not try to predict what will happen in the future.",
    "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced a series of reports that provide a comprehensive assessment of the latest scientific research on climate change; these reports have been widely cited and have helped inform policy decisions around the world."

    "The scientific consensus on the reality of human-caused climate change has been clear for decades, with over 97% of peer-reviewed studies agreeing that it is real and caused by human activities."
