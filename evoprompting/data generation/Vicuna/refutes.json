        "Evidence": "The IPCC is a global organization that brings together the world's leading climate scientists to produce authoritative reports on the state of the science of climate change. Its reports are widely regarded as the most authoritative source of information on climate change. "
    },
    {
        "Claim": "The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed. ",
        "Evidence": "The authors found that 3974 of the abstracts expressed a position on anthropogenic global warming, and that 97.1% of those endorsed the consensus that humans are causing global warming. "
    },
    {
        "Claim": "\"The climate is always changing, so it's not clear that the current warming trend is caused by human activity. ",
        "Evidence": "The current warming trend is consistent with the expected response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, and there is no known natural mechanism that could cause such a rapid warming. "
    },
    {
        "Claim": "\"The climate has always changed, so it's not clear that the current warming trend is a problem. ",
        "Evidence": "The current warming trend is causing significant impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human health, and it is likely to continue and even accelerate in the future. "
    },
    {
        "Claim": "\"The climate models used to predict future warming are unreliable, and they have been proven wrong in the past. ",
        "Evidence": "Climate models have been tested and validated using a wide range of observations, and they have proven to be highly accurate in predicting the current warming trend and its impacts. "
